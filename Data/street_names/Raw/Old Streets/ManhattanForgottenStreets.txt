Broadway, 1807, near the present Grace Church, Henry BREVOORT 
	kept a tavern. New York was changing quickly, there were

TRINITY CHURCH
According to the bk "In Olde New York"
Janvier, Thomas
1894
Copyright renewed 1922 and reprinted April 2000.
Has been reprinted and available for purchase.
A wonderful source for Manhattan seraching.

The land that Trinity Church is on was the farm lnds of 
Leonard LISPENARD. The farm to which this related was a portion of 
the estate that was known to successive generations as the Duke's 
Farm, the Kings"s Farm, the Queens's Farm and finally when it became 
by gift the property of finally the English Church-as the Church Farm.
Lispenard's holdings, of wgich he was the lessee from Trinity, was 
styled specifically the Dominie's BOUERIE, or the Dominie's Hook,
and was a considerable property lying b/w the North River and a bit 
of Swamp where now is West Broadway.
The southern line of the farm was close upon present Reade St. 
extending to the southern edge of the wide valley thru which 
discharged lazily into the Hudson the stream from the Collect, or 
Fresh Water Pond..
Where that stream then was, Canal Street is now.

"Great Queen's Farm" was originally the Company's Farm, set aside 
by the Dutch for the hands of the Company.Upon the English conquest 
this became the private property of the Duke of York., 
Duke's Farm.Later in 1670, by purchase from the estate of 
Annetje Jans. When the Duke ascended to the throne, it became known 
as The Kings Farm. and The Queen's Farm upon the assension of 
Queen Anne.In this last reign 1705, then Gov. Lord CORNBURY, 
granted the entire estate to the English Church on the 
"Island of New York".


On the Line of Monument Lane or Greenwich Lane, lay Potter's Field, 
a part of which is Washington Square. In 1794 it was established at 
the junction of the Post Road & Bloomingdale Rd, on land now a part 
of Madison Square, but this site was abandoned 3 years later because 
the United States Arsenal was erected here, and partly because it was
an intrusion of pauper graves upon the fashionable drive.
In 1797 the move was made to the northside of the lane at abt foot 
of the present %th Ave., until 1823.It was not strictly a pauper's 
graveyard, a fact that was demonstrated when by the unearthing of 
tombstones(which paupers could not afford) while excavations were 
in progress, in the summer of 1890, for the Washington Arch. 
The tombstones disappeared .

Sailor's Snug Home was originally the estate of ELIOT, which later 
was owned by Capt. Robert Richard RANDALL and bequeathered to him 
for the home. June 1, 1801.
The estate was north of Greenwich Lane, extending from the 
Bowery across to abt the easterly line of present 5th Ave. 
Comprised of 21 acres and also 2 to 3 lots in the 1st Ward.

A gallows was set up near the present Washington Arch.
